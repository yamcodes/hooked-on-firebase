## Why?

From [react-firebase-hooks](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks)'s original _Why?_:

> This library explores how React Hooks can work to make integration with Firebase even more straightforward than it already is. It takes inspiration for naming from RxFire and is based on an internal library that we had been using in a number of apps prior to the release of React Hooks. The implementation with hooks is 10x simpler than our previous implementation.
